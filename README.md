# phonebook_system

Hello our aim is to make phonebook system. 
Currently we are working with two versions.

First in order to understand the functionality we aimed at making a simple file handling phonebook system in C++.

Second version aims at further optimizing the search and other operations by implementing tries. File handling here deals
with serializing and deserializing the trie to write and read it from the file.It is currently in progress.
