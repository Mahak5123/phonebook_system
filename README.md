# phonebook_system

Hello our aim is to make phonebook system. 
Currently we have a simple file handling phonebook system. We need to further optimize it by implementing tries . It is in process. If anybody of you are confident enough please make a new file in this repository with tries implemented. The file handling would still be reqired but insteaad of reading a  single record one after another, we will read and write a trie itself from the file and perform further operations on it.
